We aspire to be a casual neighborhood refuge. The menu, which is inspired by London’s modern gastropubs, is composed of small plates with a theme of local seasonality and is inspired by our travels throughout Europe. The wine list is old world. The cocktails are earnest and straightforward. The hospitality is warm and casual.
