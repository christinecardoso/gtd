Yes, you can substitute agave syrup for honey in this recipe! Here are a few tips for making the adjustment:

1. Sweetness and Flavor: Agave is slightly sweeter than honey but has a milder flavor. Use the same amount as honey (in this case, 2 tablespoons for one loaf or 1/4 cup for two loaves) for a similar level of sweetness.

2. Moisture: Agave is slightly thinner than honey, so the dough might feel a bit wetter. If needed, you can add a little extra flour (start with 1–2 tablespoons) to achieve the right dough consistency.

3. Baking Performance: Agave will work just as well as honey in helping to feed the sourdough starter and contribute to browning during baking.

  

This substitution won’t significantly change the texture or rise of the bread. Just mix and adjust as needed!
