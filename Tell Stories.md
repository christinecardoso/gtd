WHAT WOULD BE YOUR DREAM PROJECT?  
I just love to tell stories. I just want to make awesome stories with interesting people in any shape or form, whether itâ€™s already in them or creating them. Learning new ways to create with the technology we have access to is super important to me. Pushing the limit. I guess the dream would be to make a film and have it go to Cannes Film Festival one day.

Tell stories about places you've been
Stories you've been told
Fun memories.. recreate them like the Gap book

Cool stories:
- Big Sur (do you have any food)
- (analyze the title "nostalgia killer" and conceptualize more ideas similar to that)

Explore concepts:
- how modern trends have replaced or altered past traditions
