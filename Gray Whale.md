I would buy it if the 12 pack had the dia de los muwrtos on it. They wanted to see if the designs were different on every bottle. They didnâ€™t know it was part of modelo group.

Someone was disappointed there was no Victoria in the cooler cold. They were looking for cold beer. I went to the cooler myself to physically check for them.

Someone bought a 6 pack

cuama for the design 

Cuama - a big ass bottle of beer
