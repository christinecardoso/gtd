Domaselo Bakery sourdough breads are amazing. Continue the excellence and production of bread.  
  
Now they introduced specialty breads. This week they started with The Pizza Bread mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, oregano, and basil. This specialty bread is delicious and multiple use options.  
  
We made open face turkey balls sandwiches, perfect combo.  
  
The owner is a great person and hard working using the best ingredients and local sourcing. Must try by visiting bakery from 5 to 9 PM.  
  
The Tomato and Garlic and Cinnamon Raisin specialty breads were amazing.  
  
We get the country bread that gives options and is always a hit with visitors.  
  
Last week of May it is the French Onion Bread. It taste just like the soup with the cheese. Amazing to have this taste without having soup in the Miami hot weather.  
  
Like always owner and staff very friendly and attentive even when they are busy like to day with customers and shipping bread out.


**Healthier**

Sourdough bread made with organic ingredients is simply healthier for you to consume. 

  

**Easier to Digest**

(Real) Sourdough bread takes a minimum of 24 hours to make, and supermarket bread takes 2 hours.  The slow sourdough method makes it easy for us to digest it.

  

**Flavor & Texture**

Sourdough bread has an amazing aroma from the fermentation process (the real smell of bread). It has a crust that is crunchy and a crumb that is airy and soft. Simply amazing!

#### **STAPLE BREAD MENU**

#### AVAILABLE DAILY

All of our bread is sourdough! This means that it is leavened naturally without any commercial yeast, not that it is overly sour. Every loaf contains whole grain and all of our flour is 100% organic and sourced from local mills.

#### VOLLKORNBROT - 6

A wholegrain rye loaf. Best sliced thin, toasted, and eaten open-faced. Slightly tangy from the double fermentation process and will last for weeks on your counter or in your fridge.

#### EINKORN + SPELT - 8

Made with whole einkorn and whole spelt and hydrated with Halfway Crooks beer and Banner buttermilk, this loaf looks a bit humble but is full of flavor and has a surprisingly creamy interior. Contains flaxseed, pepitas, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.

#### MULTIGRAIN - 9

Made with a soaker containing organic oats, DaySpring Farms cornmeal, poppyseeds, millet, Carolina Ground whole rye flour, and sesame seeds. Coated in a multitude of toasty seeds.

#### MICHE - 12

A wholegrain sourdough loaf baked in its traditional large format. This loaf is 1.5 kilos, so we also offer it as a half or quarter loaf. Made with Dayspring Farms high extraction wheat flour and Carolina Ground wholegrain spelt flour and leavened with our rye levain, it has a robust flavor and a good bit of tang.

#### COUNTRY SOUR - 7

Our most basic hearth loaf. Made with 40% whole grain, it is slightly sour with a wheaty flavor.

#### SANDWICH LOAF - 9

Country sourdough, but baked in a tin to achieve a softer crust and a closer crumb. Sold whole or halved.
