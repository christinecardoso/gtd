Pie pumpkins have arrived! You can't have Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie, but there are many more uses for fresh pumpkin besides pie.  Pumpkin is great in a variety of desserts (cheesecakes, cookies, bars), mixed into oatmeal, soup, ravioli, chili, pancakes, breads, spread on a bagel... and so much more.  

Pie pumpkins, also known as sugar pumpkins, are a variety that is intended to be cooked and eaten.  It's a rather small pumpkin in comparison to the jack-o'-lantern type.  It is very fleshy and pulpy, tastes much sweeter, and has a lot less water inside.  Mmmm, these taste delicious!  

Making pumpkin puree from a fresh pie pumpkin is very easy.  It will put anything you make with it over the top.  One cup fresh pumpkin puree  = one cup canned pumpkin.  No changes are required.  

Rorabeck's has pie pumpkins in stock, while supplies last.  You can easily make your pumpkin puree in advance, and freeze it until needed.  Freeze in an airtight container, and thaw in the fridge overnight.  

Fresh Pumpkin Puree 

Preheat your oven to 325 degrees.  Cut your pumpkin in half, and remove seeds and any stringy bits.  Place your pumpkin halves, cut side down, on to a foil lined baking sheet.  Bake until the flesh is fork tender, about 35-40 minutes.  Allow your pumpkin halves to cool enough to be handled.  Scoop out all the flesh, and put into either a food processor or blender, and process until creamy and smooth.  If any chunks or stringy texture remains, just keep blending, it will become super smooth.  Voila!  You now have fresh pumpkin puree.  Most pumpkin pie recipes call for 2 cups of pumpkin.
