Here's a kimchi recipe using the ingredients you listed:

### Cabbage and Mustard Greens Kimchi with Apple and Carrot

**Ingredients:**
- 1 small napa cabbage (or use half of a larger one)
- 1 bunch mustard greens
- 1 apple, peeled and grated
- 2 carrots, julienned
- 4 green onions, chopped
- 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, minced
- 2-3 tbsp gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes) â€“ adjust to taste
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 3-4 tbsp sea salt (non-iodized)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - Cut the napa cabbage into bite-sized pieces. Rinse and drain.
   - Rinse the mustard greens and chop them into bite-sized pieces.
   - In a large bowl, mix the cabbage and mustard greens with the salt. Massage the salt into the leaves until they start to soften and release some liquid.
   - Set aside for 1-2 hours, tossing occasionally. The vegetables will reduce in volume and become more pliable.

2. **Rinse and Drain:**
   - After the cabbage and mustard greens have softened, rinse them thoroughly under cold water to remove excess salt. Drain well and set aside.

3. **Prepare the Kimchi Paste:**
   - In a separate bowl, combine the grated apple, julienned carrots, chopped green onions, minced garlic, minced ginger, gochugaru, and sugar. Mix well until it forms a paste.

4. **Combine:**
   - Add the cabbage and mustard greens to the kimchi paste. Using your hands (wear gloves if you prefer), thoroughly mix the paste with the vegetables, ensuring everything is evenly coated.

5. **Pack the Kimchi:**
   - Pack the kimchi into a clean, airtight jar or container, pressing down to remove air pockets. Leave some space at the top, as the kimchi will expand as it ferments.

6. **Fermentation:**
   - Leave the jar at room temperature for 1-2 days to start the fermentation process. You'll see bubbles forming and a sour smell developing.
   - After 1-2 days, taste the kimchi. If it's fermented to your liking, transfer it to the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation process. If you prefer it more fermented, leave it out for another day.

7. **Serve:**
   - Enjoy your homemade kimchi as a side dish, in rice bowls, or however you like!

This kimchi should keep for several weeks in the fridge, getting more sour and complex in flavor over time.
