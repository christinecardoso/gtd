Makes: 1 Loaf | Prep Time: 13+ Hours | Cook Time: 40 Minutes


Ingredients:

• ½ cup (100g) active, bubbly sourdough starter

• 1 ⅓ cups (300g) warm filtered water

• 2 Tbsp (42g) raw honey

• 3½–4 cups (525–600g) bread flour (adjust based on dough consistency and humidity)

• 1½ Tbsp (20g) olive oil

• 2 tsp (12g) Himalayan salt

  

Directions:

  

Step 1: Mix the Dough

1. In a large bowl, mix the starter, warm water, and honey until the mixture looks milky.

2. Add the bread flour, olive oil, and salt. Stir with a dough whisk or your hands until the mixture forms a thick, shaggy dough.

3. Lightly flour your hands and continue mixing by hand until most of the flour is incorporated. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 45–60 minutes (autolyse).

  

Step 2: Stretch and Fold

4. Perform 3–4 rounds of stretch-and-folds over the next hour, spacing each round 15–20 minutes apart. To do this, grab one edge of the dough, stretch it upwards, and fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl and repeat for all four sides.

5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let it sit at room temperature for 8–10 hours (overnight proof). The dough will expand significantly.

  

Step 3: Shape the Dough

6. In the morning, lightly flour your countertop and turn the dough out onto it. Gently press to release any large air bubbles.

7. Shape the dough into a rectangle, then roll it tightly into a log. Let it rest for 10 minutes, seam side down.

  

Step 4: Prepare for Baking

8. Grease a bread pan with olive oil or butter.

9. Gently shape the dough by tucking and pinching the sides under to create a taut surface. Place the shaped dough seam side down into the prepared pan.

10. Cover the pan with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 2–3 hours, or until it doubles in size.

  

Step 5: Bake the Bread

11. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

12. Bake the loaf for 40 minutes, or until the top is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

13. Remove the loaf from the oven and immediately brush the top with melted butter for a soft crust. Let the bread cool for 1–2 hours before slicing.

  

Notes:

• Over-proofing Tip: If the dough appears slightly over-fermented, it should still rise in the oven during baking.

• Storage: Store the loaf in a bread bag or tightly wrapped at room temperature for 2–3 days.

• Serving Suggestions: Perfect for sandwiches, French toast, or with butter, jam, or honey.
