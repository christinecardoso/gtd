You can absolutely make Coq au Vin using chicken breast with rib meat. Here's how to modify the recipe:

### Modified Coq au Vin Recipe with Chicken Breast

**Ingredients:**
- 4 chicken breasts with rib meat
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 slices thick-cut bacon, diced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups red wine (Burgundy or any full-bodied red wine)
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 bay leaf
- 3-4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 cup pearl onions, peeled
- 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
   - In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.

2. **Brown the Chicken:**
   - Add the butter to the pot with the bacon fat. Once melted, add the chicken breasts, skin-side down if they have skin, and brown lightly on both sides. This should take about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside. 

3. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   - In the same pot, add the diced onion and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

4. **Thicken the Sauce:**
   - Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the flour is lightly browned.
   - Slowly pour in the red wine, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add the chicken broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, and thyme. Stir until everything is well combined.

5. **Simmer the Chicken:**
   - Return the chicken breasts to the pot, along with any accumulated juices. Bring the liquid to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for about 25-30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through but still tender. Avoid overcooking the chicken breast to prevent it from drying out.

6. **Cook the Onions and Mushrooms:**
   - While the chicken is cooking, in a separate pan, sauté the pearl onions and mushrooms in a bit of butter until they are golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.

7. **Combine and Finish:**
   - Once the chicken is cooked, add the sautéed pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot. Simmer uncovered for another 10 minutes to allow the sauce to reduce slightly.
   - Remove the bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

8. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with chopped parsley and serve Coq au Vin with crusty bread, mashed potatoes, or buttered noodles.

This version with chicken breast will be lighter but still flavorful. Be careful not to overcook the chicken breast to keep it juicy and tender.
