Here's a classic Pho #soup recipe, which is a popular #Vietnamese [[Noodle Soup]] with a flavorful broth, tender beef, and fresh herbs.
### Ingredients:
#### For the Broth:
- 4 lbs beef bones (preferably marrow and knuckle bones)
- 1 large onion, halved
- 4-inch piece of ginger, halved
- 5-6 star anise
- 3-4 whole cloves
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 tbsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp whole peppercorns
- 1/4 cup fish sauce
- 2 tbsp sugar
- Salt to taste
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 12 cups water

#### For the Soup:
- 1 lb beef sirloin or brisket, thinly sliced
- 14 oz rice noodles (pho noodles)
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 3-4 green onions, chopped
- Fresh herbs: cilantro, Thai basil, mint
- Bean sprouts
- Lime wedges
- Fresh chili slices (optional)
- Hoisin sauce (optional)
- Sriracha (optional)

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Broth:
1. **Preheat the Oven**:
	1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).

2. **Prepare the Bones**:
	1. Rinse: Rinse 1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) of beef bones under cold running water to remove any surface blood and impurities.
	1. Dry: Pat the bones dry with paper towels.

3. **Roast Bones**:
	- **Arrange:** Place the bones in a single layer on a baking sheet or roasting pan. If desired, you can also roast the onion and ginger alongside the bones.
	- **Roast:** Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-45 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the bones are deeply browned and caramelized.
 4. **Prepare the Aromatics:**
	- **Char Onion and Ginger:** While the bones are roasting, you can char a large onion and a piece of ginger over an open flame or in a dry pan until the surfaces are blackened. On a grill or over an open flame, char the onion and ginger until blackened on all sides. Alternatively, you can broil them in the oven for 10-15 minutes.
 5. **Transfer to Pot:**
	- **Remove from Oven:** Once the bones are roasted, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a large pot.
	- **Deglaze Pan:** For additional flavor, you can deglaze the baking sheet with a small amount of water, scraping up any browned bits, and add this liquid to the pot with the bones.
 1. **Toast Spices**: In a dry pan, toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and peppercorns until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.
 1. **Simmer the Broth:**
	- **Add Water:** Cover the bones with cold water (about 5 liters or 20 cups, depending on the recipe).
	- **Add Aromatics:** Add the charred onion and ginger to the pot, along with your spices (star anise, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, peppercorns).
	- **Simmer:** Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface. Simmer for at least 6-8 hours, or as long as desired for a rich flavor.
2. **Simmer Broth**: In a large pot, add the roasted bones, charred onion and ginger, toasted spices, fish sauce, sugar, and salt. Add 12 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for 4-6 hours. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.

3. **Season and Strain the Broth**: 
	1. After simmering, strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into another pot, discarding the solids. 
	2. Add 60 ml (about 4 tablespoons) of fish sauce to the strained broth. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more fish sauce, salt, or sugar as needed.

#### Assembling the Soup:
1. **Cook Noodles**: Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

2. **Prepare Beef**: 
	1. If using beef sirloin, place the slices in the refrigerator until ready to use. Thinly slice beef sirloin (about 300 grams or 10 oz).
	2. If using brisket, you can cook it in the broth until tender, then thinly slice.

4. **Assemble Bowls**: Divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Arrange the raw beef slices on top (the hot broth will cook the beef). 

5. **Garnish and Serve**: 
	- Pour the hot broth over the noodles and beef. 
	- Add the sliced onion and green onions. 
	- Garnish with fresh herbs (Thai basil, cilantro, mint), bean sprouts, and sliced green onions.
	- Serve with lime wedges, hoisin sauce, sriracha, and sliced chili peppers on the side.
	- Serve with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and additional condiments like hoisin sauce, Sriracha, and chili slices.

Enjoy your homemade pho!
