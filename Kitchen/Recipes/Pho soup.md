Here's a classic Pho soup recipe, which is a popular Vietnamese noodle soup with a flavorful broth, tender beef, and fresh herbs.

### Ingredients:
#### For the Broth:
- 4 lbs beef bones (preferably marrow and knuckle bones)
- 1 large onion, halved
- 4-inch piece of ginger, halved
- 5-6 star anise
- 3-4 whole cloves
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 tbsp fennel seeds
- 1 tsp whole peppercorns
- 1/4 cup fish sauce
- 2 tbsp sugar
- Salt to taste
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 12 cups water

#### For the Soup:
- 1 lb beef sirloin or brisket, thinly sliced
- 14 oz rice noodles (pho noodles)
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 3-4 green onions, chopped
- Fresh herbs: cilantro, Thai basil, mint
- Bean sprouts
- Lime wedges
- Fresh chili slices (optional)
- Hoisin sauce (optional)
- Sriracha (optional)

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Broth:
1. **Roast Bones**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Place the beef bones on a baking sheet and roast for about 30 minutes, turning once until browned.

2. **Char Onion and Ginger**: On a grill or over an open flame, char the onion and ginger until blackened on all sides. Alternatively, you can broil them in the oven for 10-15 minutes.

3. **Toast Spices**: In a dry pan, toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and peppercorns until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Simmer Broth**: In a large pot, add the roasted bones, charred onion and ginger, toasted spices, fish sauce, sugar, and salt. Add 12 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for 4-6 hours. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.

5. **Strain Broth**: After simmering, strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into another pot, discarding the solids. Taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce, sugar, or salt if needed.

#### Assembling the Soup:
1. **Cook Noodles**: Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

2. **Prepare Beef**: If using beef sirloin, place the slices in the refrigerator until ready to use. If using brisket, you can cook it in the broth until tender, then thinly slice.

3. **Assemble Bowls**: Divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Arrange the raw beef slices on top (the hot broth will cook the beef). 

4. **Serve**: Pour the hot broth over the noodles and beef. Add the sliced onion and green onions. Serve with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and additional condiments like hoisin sauce, Sriracha, and chili slices.

Enjoy your homemade pho!
