  - 3 shallots, peeled and chopped
  - 1 tsp ground coriander
  - 1 tsp ground cumin
  - 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
  - 1 tsp shrimp paste (optional, or use 1 tsp soy sauce for vegetarian)
  - Zest of 1 lime (or 2 tsp lime zest)
  - 1-2 tbsp water (to blend)

- **For the Curry:**
  - 2 lbs (900g) beef short ribs, trimmed of excess fat and cut into individual ribs
  - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
  - 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
  - 1 1/2 cups beef broth
  - 2 tbsp fish sauce
  - 1 tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)
  - 1-2 kaffir lime leaves, torn into pieces (optional)
  - 1 red bell pepper, sliced
  - 1 zucchini, sliced
  - Fresh Thai basil or cilantro, for garnish
  - Steamed jasmine rice, for serving

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Make the Red Curry Paste:**
   - In a blender or food processor, combine the 3-4 fresh red chilies, 1-2 tsp crushed chili peppers, 5 cloves of garlic, 2-3 stalks of chopped lemongrass, 1-inch piece of galangal or ginger, 3 chopped shallots, 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1 tsp shrimp paste (or soy sauce), and the zest of 1 lime. Add 1-2 tbsp water to help blend into a smooth paste. Set aside.

2. **Sear the Short Ribs:**
   - Heat 2 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the 2 lbs of short ribs on all sides until browned, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the short ribs and set them aside.

3. **Cook the Curry Paste:**
   - In the same pot, reduce the heat to medium and add the prepared red curry paste. Saut√© the paste for 2-3 minutes until fragrant, stirring frequently.

4. **Simmer the Short Ribs:**
   - Return the seared short ribs to the pot. Add 1 can (14 oz) of coconut milk, 1 1/2 cups of beef broth, 2 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp palm sugar, and 1-2 torn kaffir lime leaves (if using). Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer.
   - Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the short ribs simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.

5. **Add Vegetables:**
   - About 20 minutes before the short ribs are done, add the sliced red bell pepper and zucchini to the pot. Allow the vegetables to cook until tender but still vibrant.

6. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Once the short ribs are tender and the vegetables are cooked, taste the curry and adjust the seasoning with additional fish sauce or sugar if needed.
   - Serve the curry over steamed jasmine rice, garnished with fresh Thai basil or cilantro.

This Thai red curry with short ribs is a deliciously rich and hearty dish, perfect for when you want something comforting yet full of bold, spicy flavors. Enjoy!
