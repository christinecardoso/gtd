Here's a classic borscht recipe that you can enjoy either hot or cold:

### Ingredients:
**For the Soup:**
- 1 lb (about 3 medium) beets, peeled and grated or julienned
- 1 large carrot, peeled and grated
- 1 large potato, peeled and diced
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 small head of cabbage, shredded
- 1 medium tomato, chopped (or 1 tablespoon tomato paste)
- 4 cups beef or vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh dill or parsley for garnish

**For Serving:**
- Sour cream
- Rye bread

### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Vegetables:**
   1. Peel and grate or julienne the beets and carrots. Dice the potatoes and finely chop the onion. Shred the cabbage.

**2. Sauté the Vegetables:**
   1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
   2. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute.
   3. Add the grated beets and carrots. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften.

**3. Add the Broth and Potatoes:**
   1. Pour in the beef or vegetable broth and add the diced potatoes.
   2. Stir in the chopped tomato or tomato paste. Add the bay leaf.
   3. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

**4. Add the Cabbage and Seasoning:**
   1. Stir in the shredded cabbage and simmer for another 10-15 minutes until the cabbage is tender.
   2. Add the vinegar or lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed.

**5. Serve:**
   1. Remove the bay leaf before serving. Ladle the borscht into bowls.
   2. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill or parsley.
   3. Serve with rye bread on the side.

### Tips:
- Borscht can be enjoyed hot or chilled, making it versatile for any season.
- If you like your borscht to have more depth, you can add a small amount of meat like beef or pork to the broth.
- Leftover borscht often tastes even better the next day, as the flavors have more time to meld together.

Enjoy your borscht!
