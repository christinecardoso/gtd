#### Ingredients:

##### For the Broth:
- 1 whole chicken (about 1.5 kg / 3.3 lbs), cut into pieces
- 2 stalks lemongrass, trimmed and bruised
- 1 large onion, quartered
- 1 piece of ginger (about 2 inches), sliced
- 2-3 garlic cloves, smashed
- 1.5 liters (6 cups) water
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste

##### For the Soup:
- 2-3 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 2 potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 large tomato, quartered
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 stalk lemongrass, finely minced
- 2-3 kaffir lime leaves (optional, for extra aroma)
- 1 tsp chili flakes (optional, for a spicy kick)
- Fresh herbs for garnish (cilantro, Thai basil)
- Lime wedges for serving

### Instructions:

#### 1. **Prepare the Chicken and Broth:**
   - Rinse the chicken under cold water and pat it dry.
   - In a large pot, add the chicken pieces, 2 bruised lemongrass stalks, 1 quartered onion, sliced ginger, and smashed garlic cloves.
   - Pour in 1.5 liters (6 cups) of water and bring to a boil.
   - Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface.
   - Simmer for about 30-40 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the broth is flavorful.

#### 2. **Strain the Broth:**
   - Remove the chicken pieces from the pot and set aside to cool slightly.
   - Strain the broth through a fine sieve to remove the aromatics (lemongrass, onion, ginger, garlic), leaving a clear broth.
   - Return the strained broth to the pot.

#### 3. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   - In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat.
   - Add the minced lemongrass and sauté until fragrant.
   - Add the sliced carrots, cubed potatoes, and quartered tomato to the pan, and sauté for 2-3 minutes to combine flavors.

#### 4. **Add Vegetables to Broth:**
   - Add the sautéed vegetables to the pot with the broth.
   - If using, add 2-3 kaffir lime leaves and 1 teaspoon of chili flakes to the pot for extra aroma and heat.
   - Simmer the soup for another 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.

#### 5. **Shred the Chicken:**
   - While the soup simmers, remove the skin and bones from the cooked chicken. Shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.
   - Add the shredded chicken back to the soup.

#### 6. **Season and Serve:**
   - Season the soup with 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and salt and pepper to taste.
   - Simmer for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

#### 7. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs like cilantro and Thai basil.
   - Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup.

This Vietnamese chicken soup with lemongrass is light yet flavorful, making it a delicious and refreshing option for a meal.
