### Instructions:

#### 1. **Prepare the Bones and Meat:**
   - Rinse 750 g (1.65 lbs) of beef bones and 250 g (0.55 lbs) of pork hock under cold water. Place them in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes to remove impurities.
   - Drain and rinse the bones and meat under cold running water.

#### 2. **Simmer the Broth:**
   - In a clean pot, add the rinsed bones, 250 g (0.55 lbs) of beef shank, the pork hock, 1 halved onion, 1.5-inch piece of sliced ginger, and 1 bruised stalk of lemongrass.
   - Add 2-3 star anise, 2-3 cloves, 1 bay leaf, and 1/2 cinnamon stick.
   - Cover with 1.75 liters (7-8 cups) of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 2-3 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
   - After about 1 hour, remove the beef shank and set it aside to cool. Continue simmering the broth with the remaining ingredients.

#### 3. **Add Shrimp Paste:**
   - In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of shrimp paste with a little of the hot broth. Stir until dissolved, then add this mixture back to the simmering broth.
   - Season with 1 tablespoon of fish sauce and 1/2 tablespoon of sugar. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.

#### 4. **Prepare the Aromatic Oil:**
   - Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a small pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of annatto seeds and cook until the oil turns a deep red. If using paprika, add it instead of the annatto seeds.
   - Strain out the seeds (if using annatto) and then add 1 minced garlic clove, 1 minced shallot, and 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder. Sauté until fragrant, then add this mixture to the broth.

#### 5. **Cook the Noodles:**
   - Cook 250 g (0.55 lbs) of Bún (thick rice noodles) according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.

#### 6. **Assemble and Serve:**
   - Thinly slice the cooled beef shank and arrange it in serving bowls along with pieces of pork hock.
   - Add a portion of cooked noodles to each bowl.
   - Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and meat.

#### 7. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Garnish with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, green onions, and banana blossoms.
   - Serve with lime wedges, chili peppers, and extra fish sauce on the side.

This halved recipe provides a more manageable portion size while retaining the rich, complex flavors of traditional Bún Bò Huế.
