Yes, you can use crushed chili peppers from a spice container to make pho chili paste. Crushed chili peppers are typically made from dried red chilies, and they can provide the heat and flavor needed for the paste. 
Here's how you can use them:

### Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup crushed chili peppers
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1 small shallot, peeled and chopped
- 1 tablespoon sugar (adjust to taste)
- 1 tablespoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (plus extra for storing)
- 1 tablespoon vinegar or lime juice (optional for tanginess)
- 1-2 tablespoons water (if needed for blending)

### Instructions:

1. **Blend Ingredients:**
   - Combine the crushed chili peppers, garlic, shallot, sugar, salt, and vinegar in a blender or food processor.
   - Blend until the mixture forms a smooth paste, adding water if needed to achieve the desired consistency.

2. **Cook the Paste:**
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.
   - Add the chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5-10 minutes until the paste thickens and the oil begins to separate from the paste.

3. **Cool and Store:**
   - Let the chili paste cool before transferring it to a clean, airtight jar.
   - For longer storage, pour a thin layer of oil over the top to seal it from air, and store in the refrigerator for up to a month.

### Notes:
- Using crushed chili peppers will give your paste a slightly different texture compared to using whole dried chilies, but the flavor will still be delicious.
- Adjust the amount of crushed chili peppers based on your heat preference.
