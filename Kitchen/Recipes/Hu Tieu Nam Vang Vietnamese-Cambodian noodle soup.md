- 1 lb chicken bones (optional)
- 1 lb pork shoulder or tenderloin, whole
- 6 cups water
- 1 small dried squid or 2 dried shrimp (optional, for extra umami flavor)
- 1 large onion, peeled and halved
- 1 daikon radish, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed

- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### For the Toppings:
- 1/2 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1/2 lb squid, cleaned and sliced into rings
- 1/2 lb [[ground pork]]
- 1/2 lb pork liver or heart, sliced thinly (optional)
- 4 boiled quail eggs (optional)
- 1/4 cup fried shallots
- Fresh herbs: cilantro, Thai basil, sawtooth coriander (ngo gai)
- Bean sprouts
- Lime wedges
- Fresh chili slices (optional)

#### For the Noodles:
- 14 oz Hu Tieu noodles (or thin rice noodles)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Broth:
1. **Blanch the Bones**: In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the pork and chicken bones and boil for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse the bones under cold water to remove impurities.

2. **Simmer the Broth**: In a clean pot, add the blanched bones, pork shoulder, dried squid or shrimp (if using), onion, daikon radish, garlic, sugar, and fish sauce. Cover with 6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let it simmer gently for about 2 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.

3. **Cook the Pork Shoulder**: After simmering for about 1 hour, remove the pork shoulder from the broth and let it cool. Slice it thinly and set aside as a topping.

4. **Strain the Broth**: Once the broth is done simmering, strain it through a fine mesh sieve into another pot, discarding the solids. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep the broth warm over low heat.

#### Preparing the Toppings:
1. **Cook the Shrimp and Squid**: Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the shrimp and cook until pink, about 2 minutes. Remove and set aside. Add the squid rings to the same pot and cook for 1-2 minutes, then remove and set aside.

2. **Cook the Ground Pork**: In a pan, heat 1 tbsp of oil over medium heat. Add the ground pork and cook until browned. Season with salt and pepper.

3. **Prepare Pork Liver or Heart**: If using, blanch the pork liver or heart slices in boiling water for about 2 minutes until just cooked through. Set aside.

#### Assembling the Soup:
1. **Cook the Noodles**: Cook the Hu Tieu noodles according to package instructions. Drain and toss with a little vegetable oil and soy sauce to prevent sticking.

2. **Assemble Bowls**: Divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Top with sliced pork shoulder, cooked shrimp, squid, ground pork, and pork liver or heart (if using). Add a boiled quail egg to each bowl if desired.

3. **Serve**: Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and toppings. Garnish with fresh herbs, fried shallots, and bean sprouts. Serve with lime wedges, chili slices, and additional fish sauce or soy sauce on the side.

Enjoy your delicious Hu Tieu Nam Vang!
