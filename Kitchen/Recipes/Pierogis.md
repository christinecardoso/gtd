Here's a classic potato and cheese pierogi recipe:

### Ingredients:
**For the Dough:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened and cut into small pieces

**For the Filling:**
- 1 lb (about 4 medium) potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or a cheese of your choice)
- 1/2 cup ricotta cheese (optional, for creaminess)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For Serving:**
- 1/2 cup butter, melted
- Chopped fresh herbs (like dill or parsley) for garnish
- Sour cream for serving

### Instructions:

**1. Make the Dough:**
   1. In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.
   2. Add the egg, sour cream, and softened butter. Mix until combined.
   3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5-7 minutes.
   4. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.

**2. Make the Filling:**
   1. Cook the potatoes in a pot of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well.
   2. In a skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat and sauté the chopped onion until soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes.
   3. Mash the potatoes until smooth, then stir in the sautéed onions, cheddar cheese, and ricotta cheese (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the filling cool to room temperature.

**3. Assemble the Pierogi:**
   1. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness.
   2. Use a round cookie cutter (about 3 inches in diameter) to cut out circles from the dough.
   3. Place a spoonful of the potato and cheese filling in the center of each circle.
   4. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape and press the edges together to seal. You can crimp the edges with a fork for a decorative look.
   5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pierogi in batches, cooking for about 2-3 minutes or until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon.

**4. Serve the Pierogi:**
   1. Optional: Sauté the cooked pierogi in a pan with melted butter until they are golden brown on both sides.
   2. Serve the pierogi with additional melted butter, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs.

Enjoy your homemade pierogi!
