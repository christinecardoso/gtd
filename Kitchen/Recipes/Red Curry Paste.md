- Zest of 1 kaffir lime or 2 tsp lime zest
- 1-2 tbsp water (to blend)

**Instructions:**

3. **Store the paste:** Transfer the paste to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or freeze in portions for longer storage.

### **Ideas for Using Red Curry Paste**

1. **Thai Red Curry:** Sauté the curry paste in coconut oil, then add coconut milk, your choice of protein (chicken, tofu, shrimp), and vegetables (bell peppers, zucchini, bamboo shoots). Simmer until cooked through, and serve with jasmine rice.

2. **Curry Soup:** Add the red curry paste to a pot with chicken or vegetable broth, coconut milk, and your favorite vegetables or proteins. Simmer and enjoy as a hearty, spicy soup.

3. **Stir-Fry:** Use a spoonful of red curry paste as the base for a stir-fry. Sauté it with garlic and onions before adding your vegetables, tofu, or meat.

4. **Marinade:** Mix the red curry paste with yogurt, lime juice, and a bit of oil to create a marinade for chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Let it marinate for at least an hour before grilling or baking.

5. **Noodles:** Stir the paste into cooked rice noodles, along with a bit of coconut milk or broth, for a quick and flavorful noodle dish.

6. **Dipping Sauce:** Combine a small amount of red curry paste with some coconut milk and a touch of sugar to make a delicious dipping sauce for grilled meats or vegetables.

These are just a few ways to use red curry paste, but it’s incredibly versatile and can be adapted to suit many different dishes. Enjoy!
