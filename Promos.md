Dragon’s Milk by New Holland Brewing is a series of barrel-aged stouts, known for their rich, complex flavor profiles. Here’s a breakdown of the key variants:

  

Here are tasting notes for three variants in New Holland Brewing’s Dragon’s Milk series:

  

1. Dragon’s Milk Crimson Keep:

A unique addition to the Dragon’s Milk family, Crimson Keep is a red ale that builds on the traditional bourbon barrel aging but brings a lighter, fruitier flavor. The red ale base is balanced with subtle malt sweetness and hints of caramel, while the aging process adds layers of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. The result is a complex, yet approachable ale with a smooth finish and a medium body.

2. Dragon’s Milk Tales of Gold:

This golden ale variant offers a bright and refreshing alternative to the richer stouts. Like its stout counterpart, it’s aged in bourbon barrels, which imparts vanilla, oak, and honey flavors. Tales of Gold also carries subtle notes of caramel and fruit, with a lighter body and a crisp finish. It’s an easy-drinking ale with a pleasant, balanced sweetness.

3. Dragon’s Milk Stout (Original):

The original Dragon’s Milk stout is a bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout that boasts rich flavors of roasted malt, vanilla, and dark chocolate, with hints of caramel and oak. It’s known for its full-bodied, velvety texture and slightly warm bourbon finish. At 11% ABV, it’s a robust and decadent stout, ideal for sipping and savoring.

  

Each of these beers provides a distinct experience within the Dragon’s Milk series, from the rich and hearty stout to the lighter, more nuanced ales like Crimson Keep and Tales of Gold.
