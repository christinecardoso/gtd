## Marketplaces 
Your insight about Genuine BMW compressors and how parts are distributed in the aftermarket is spot-on. Here's an expanded view of how these parts sites operate, including FCP Euro, WorldPac, and SMP, along with tips on leveraging these marketplaces to get the best deal:

### **Distribution of Genuine BMW Parts:**
- **Dealerships and Distributors:** BMW dealerships often sell OEM parts directly to large distributors like FCP Euro, WorldPac, and SMP (Standard Motor Products) at very low margins because of the high volume of sales. This system allows these distributors to offer genuine parts at prices much lower than you would find directly at a dealership.
- **Wholesale to Public Model:** Distributors then sell these parts to the public at near-wholesale prices, making them a cost-effective option for consumers who want genuine, OEM-quality parts without paying the dealership markup.

### **Key Marketplaces for Buying Genuine BMW and Mini Parts:**

1. **FCP Euro**
   - **Overview:** Specializes in European car parts, including Mini and BMW. They focus on genuine and high-quality aftermarket parts, often sourced directly from BMW dealerships.
   - **Advantages:** 
     - Lifetime replacement guarantee on all parts, which is unique in the industry.
     - Excellent customer service with knowledgeable staff.
     - Direct access to parts at wholesale prices due to high-volume dealership partnerships.
   - **Best For:** Genuine BMW/Mini parts at competitive prices with an unbeatable warranty.
   - **Website:** [fcpeuro.com](https://www.fcpeuro.com)

2. **WorldPac**
   - **Overview:** One of the largest wholesale distributors of imported automotive parts in North America. They primarily serve professional repair shops but also partner with certain online retailers that sell directly to the public.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Huge inventory of OEM and genuine parts for European vehicles.
     - Competitive pricing due to direct sourcing from manufacturers and dealerships.
   - **Best For:** Finding hard-to-source OEM parts through professional shops or affiliated retailers.
   - **Note:** WorldPac doesn’t sell directly to consumers, so parts are typically accessed through affiliated online sellers.

3. **Standard Motor Products (SMP)**
   - **Overview:** SMP is a global manufacturer and distributor of automotive replacement parts, but they also handle genuine parts from dealerships for high-demand models.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Access to both genuine and high-quality aftermarket parts.
     - Known for providing reliable, quality parts across various categories.
   - **Best For:** Consumers looking for both genuine and aftermarket alternatives from a trusted distributor network.

### **Other Notable Sites with Genuine BMW and Mini Parts:**

4. **AutohausAZ**
   - **Overview:** A major online retailer known for its selection of European auto parts, including genuine and OEM BMW parts sourced from dealership channels.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Competitive pricing, often reflecting wholesale rates.
     - Wide selection of genuine parts.
   - **Best For:** Finding genuine parts with an emphasis on European brands.
   - **Website:** [autohausaz.com](https://www.autohausaz.com)

5. **Pelican Parts**
   - **Overview:** Specializes in parts for European cars, particularly Porsche, BMW, and Mini. They source genuine parts directly from dealerships, similar to FCP Euro.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Detailed product descriptions and installation guides.
     - Focus on quality parts, including genuine OEM.
   - **Best For:** Those looking for a DIY-friendly site with technical support and genuine parts.
   - **Website:** [pelicanparts.com](https://www.pelicanparts.com)

### **Tips for Getting the Best Price on Genuine Parts:**
- **Compare Prices:** Even among these distributors, prices can vary, so it’s worthwhile to compare prices on the same part number across different sites.
- **Look for Promotions or Discounts:** Sites like FCP Euro and AutohausAZ occasionally offer promotions, discounts, or free shipping deals, which can further reduce costs.
- **Lifetime Guarantees:** FCP Euro’s lifetime replacement warranty adds significant value, especially for parts that might need replacement again in the future.
- **Dealer Price Matching:** Some online retailers, like FCP Euro, may match or beat dealership prices when you contact them directly.

This approach ensures you get high-quality, genuine parts at a fraction of the dealership price, leveraging the high-volume, low-margin distribution model these sites operate under.

If you're looking to compare Threads to Twitter... there was some talk about it in the past: [https://www.skool.com/nma/is-twitter-still-better-than-threads?p=785e4460](https://www.skool.com/nma/is-twitter-still-better-than-threads?p=785e4460 "https://www.skool.com/nma/is-twitter-still-better-than-threads?p=785e4460")


App Like Template vs Content Template

Looking at the different notion templates I see two main kinds:

- App-like Templates: These include templates such as task managers, habit trackers, CRM systems, project planners, etc. They are designed to function like applications within Notion, helping users manage tasks, track habits, organize projects, etc.
- Content/Information Templates: These are more focused on delivering content in a structured way, like guides, courses, etc. Notion serves as a platform for presenting and interacting with the content.

I was wondering if folks here: 1. create both types of templates or if you have a preferred type, and 2. if you have more success in one of these categories?

Both: 1st type as paid. 2nd type as freebie or bonus? 🤔

For my mental health templates I created templates (OS) and courses and bundled them. It´s a nice way for an upsell.

People bought templates or bundles, never courses only until now.



Recommendations to make a website (showcase templates + consulting)?

Hello everyone! I want to create my own website to display all my templates and start offering my consulting services (I'll sell them through Gumroad, the website is just for info + display).


[@Lara Calvo](https://www.skool.com/@0fdc9891ad4f42fdaaa1936f62286770?g=nma) this might help... there was a post about last week about Typedream vs WordPress stack.

[https://www.skool.com/nma/best-tech-stack-for-selling-notion-templates-typedream-vs-wordpress?p=9ba4e1e7](https://www.skool.com/nma/best-tech-stack-for-selling-notion-templates-typedream-vs-wordpress?p=9ba4e1e7 "https://www.skool.com/nma/best-tech-stack-for-selling-notion-templates-typedream-vs-wordpress?p=9ba4e1e7")


Do you guys recommend any website builders or templates for the website? (free or paid, I'm willing to invest a bit for good quality). I think I remember reading that framer was a good one!

Thank you in advance!

I personally use Squarespace to host my website. Thrivecart for my sales funnels (I sell digital products and courses to help coaches and creators grow an audience and make passive sales).

Squarespace example: [https://anastasianaftalieva.co/](https://anastasianaftalieva.co/start-here "https://anastasianaftalieva.co/start-here")

Thrivecart funnel example:

In my humble opinion ☺️ I would build out a sales funnel first.. I recently launched a new product that added 1,000+ leads to my email list and all were directed straight to my sales funnel not website 😉

The long-term strategy with my website is to publish evergreen content and build SEO traffic to my offers. Still working on that 😅

P.S. I’d be more than happy to “exchange” one of my Thrivecart templates to you for an honest testimonial.


Love Thrivecart, and Studio Cart for WordPress.

Best advice: keep it SUPER simple.


I also use WordPress for all my websites (but never Elementor), I also have ThriveCart (useful on the longrun). If you want to start fast without much coding skills use Framer or Typedream - WordPress is definitly a bit advanced
