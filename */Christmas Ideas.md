Orestes only allowed his mom to come over yesterday and not my family, so honestly it was a little frustrating for me. He screamed at me that bc I accommodated my sister in law and didn‚Äôt cook the fish with the potatoes that 

Xmas eve is the bigger day for us. Honestly, O ended up being nasty to me and the fun guy in public, as usual. The worst part is that he didn‚Äôt allow my family to come both days, they were only ‚Äúallowed in his house‚Äù one day. (He gave me a hard time that I invited them at all). And then all these neighbors he casually invited over, when they actually tried to coordinate with me and take him seriously on showing up, he told me to tell them to come a different day (blow them off). So now I look like an asshole, when really he‚Äôs fake. I could go on for days. I should write a book. My sister in law and brother were awesome, so honestly I just drowned myself in cooking and focused on them. I was happy I got to see them.

BUT! He bought me an Apple Watch üëç in order to buy himself the mental stability to be a fucking dick.
