Bottom line is he was trying to get out of giving a shit about my birthday and then I basically just entertained myself and then when I said I was going to see my parents yesterday he had a fit, bc it was something he could do to cause a fight so he could “excuse” himself. And it’s just bat shit crazy. He literally told shit he was going to do and it’s always a fake story. He literally tried to tell me birthdays aren’t important and that I should basically not care about my birthday bc he has to work.
